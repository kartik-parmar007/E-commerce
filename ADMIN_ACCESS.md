# Admin Access

## How to Access Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard can be accessed by logging in with the specific admin email address:

**Admin Email:** `kartikparmar9773@gmail.com`

2. Sign in using the admin email address (`kartikparmar9773@gmail.com`) with any valid password
3. You will be automatically redirected to the admin dashboard

## Important Notes

- There are no separate admin login pages
